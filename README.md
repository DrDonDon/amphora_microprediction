# Amphora and microprediction

This repo is to demonstrate the benefits and methods for using Amphora and microprediction together. We have focused on the pandemic model 

Amphora is an invaluable data storage and collaboration tool. Any output from Microprediction can be stored and shared on Amphora in a very userfriendly and powerful manner. The output is viewable on [amphoradata.com](https://app.amphoradata.com/Amphorae/Detail?id=29ae56f6-cd0d-4e20-b6d2-9acf8fbf2495)

The main code, run.py, runs a series of pandemic models. Daily data is pushed to amphoradata.com so any user can find and use data on all the agents in the model. 

amphoraMicroPrediction.py is a module for running run.py. It is tailored for pandemic atm but will be expanded to support MicroPrediction in general
